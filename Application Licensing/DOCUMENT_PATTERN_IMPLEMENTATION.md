# Customer License Document Pattern Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the transformation of the Customer License functionality from a simple header/lines pattern to follow the **Business Central standard document pattern**, similar to Sales Orders, Purchase Orders, and other transactional documents in BC.

## Document Pattern Architecture

### Key Changes

1. **Document Flow**: Open â†’ Released â†’ Expired/Archived
2. **Document Number Series**: Automatic numbering with No. Series support
3. **Status Management**: Proper document status controls with validation
4. **Standard Fields**: Document Date, Posting Date, External Document No., etc.
5. **Audit Trail**: Created By, Modified By, Released By with timestamps
6. **Document Integrity**: Status-based editing restrictions

### Core Tables

#### Customer License Header (Table 80503)
- **Purpose**: Main document containing customer information, license timeline, and document control
- **Key Fields**:
  - `No.` (Code[20]) - Primary document number from No. Series
  - `Customer No.` (Code[20]) - Links to standard Customer table
  - `Document Date` / `Posting Date` - Standard BC document dates
  - `Status` (Enum) - Open, Released, Expired, Archived
  - `License Start Date` / `License End Date` - Overall license validity
  - `No. Series` - Document number series
  - Audit fields: Created By/Date, Modified By/Date, Released By/Date

#### Customer License Line (Table 80504)
- **Purpose**: Document lines containing application assignments and license details
- **Key Fields**:
  - `Document No.` (Code[20]) - Links to Customer License Header
  - `Line No.` (Integer) - Standard 10000 increments
  - `Type` (Enum) - Application or Comment
  - `Application ID` - Links to Application Registry
  - `License Start Date` / `License End Date` - Line-specific dates
  - `Licensed Features`, `License Seats` - Application-specific details
  - `Quantity`, `Unit Price`, `Amount` - Commercial fields

### Document Status Flow

```
Open (Editable)
  â†“ Release Action
Released (Read-only, License Generation)
  â†“ Time-based or Manual
Expired/Archived (Historical)
```

### Status Management Rules

1. **Open Status**:
   - Document is fully editable
   - Lines can be added, modified, deleted
   - Customer information can be changed
   - License dates can be updated

2. **Released Status**:
   - Document becomes read-only
   - License files are automatically generated
   - Release audit trail is recorded
   - Status can be reopened if needed

3. **Expired/Archived Status**:
   - Historical documents
   - Read-only for reporting purposes
   - Maintained for compliance and audit

## Implementation Details

### Enums Created

1. **Customer License Status** (80520):
   - Open, Released, Expired, Archived

2. **Customer License Line Type** (80521):
   - Application, Comment

### Setup Table

**Application Licensing Setup** (80521):
- Customer License Nos. (No. Series)
- Posted Customer License Nos. (No. Series)
- Default License Duration (Days)
- Auto Generate Licenses (Boolean)

### Business Logic

#### Document Initialization
- Automatic No. Series assignment
- Default dates (Document Date = Posting Date = WorkDate)
- Initial status = Open
- Audit trail initialization

#### Release Process
1. Validate required fields (Customer, Dates, Application Lines)
2. Change status to Released
3. Record release audit trail
4. Generate license files for all application lines
5. Update line status to indicate license generation

#### License Generation Integration
- Maintains compatibility with existing License Generator codeunit
- Automatic generation on document release
- Individual line generation capability
- License ID tracking per line

### Page Architecture

The document pattern includes standard BC page types:

1. **List Page** - Browse all customer license documents
2. **Card Page** - Edit individual documents with:
   - Header section (customer, dates, status)
   - Lines subpage (applications, licenses)
   - Status actions (Release, Reopen)
3. **Line Subpages** - Manage application assignments
4. **FactBox** - Document statistics and related information

### Migration Strategy

A migration utility converts existing Customer License Header/Line records to the new document pattern:

1. Create new document for each customer
2. Copy customer information to document header
3. Transfer application lines with proper line numbering
4. Set appropriate status based on license validity
5. Generate missing license files as needed

## Benefits of Document Pattern

### Business Benefits
- **Professional Document Flow**: Follows BC standards for consistency
- **Better Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of document lifecycle
- **Status Control**: Clear separation between draft and active licenses
- **Commercial Integration**: Support for pricing and quantities
- **Compliance**: Proper document numbering and archival

### Technical Benefits
- **Standard Architecture**: Uses proven BC document patterns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add custom fields and functionality
- **Integration**: Compatible with BC workflow and approval systems
- **Reporting**: Standard document reporting capabilities
- **Data Integrity**: Status-based validation prevents data corruption

### User Experience
- **Familiar Interface**: BC users recognize standard document patterns
- **Clear Status Indication**: Visual cues for document status
- **Controlled Editing**: Prevents accidental changes to active licenses
- **Efficient Navigation**: Standard list/card/subpage navigation

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components
- âœ… Customer License Header table with document pattern
- âœ… Customer License Line table with proper relationships
- âœ… Status enums and line type enum
- âœ… Application Licensing Setup table
- âœ… Permission set updates
- âœ… Core business logic procedures

### Remaining Work
- ðŸ”„ Page implementation (List, Card, Line Subpages)
- ðŸ”„ Release/Reopen actions
- ðŸ”„ Migration utility testing
- ðŸ”„ Integration with existing License Generator
- ðŸ”„ Compilation error resolution

### Known Issues
1. Table reference conflicts (need to resolve duplicate table names)
2. Enum reference issues (compilation errors)
3. Permission set enum support (not available in current BC version)
4. File corruption during table recreation (resolved)

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Compilation Errors**: Fix table and enum reference conflicts
2. **Complete Page Implementation**: Create proper List and Card pages
3. **Test Migration**: Validate data migration from old structure
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure license generation still works
5. **User Acceptance Testing**: Validate business process flow

## Technical Notes

### Field ID Strategy
- Header: 1-99 (document control, customer info, status)
- Line: 1-99 (document linking, application info, license details)
- Follows BC naming conventions and field groupings

### Performance Considerations
- Proper indexing on Document No., Customer No., Status
- FlowFields for document statistics
- Efficient line number management (10000 increments)

### Security
- Status-based editing controls
- Proper permission set coverage
- Audit trail for all document changes

This document pattern implementation transforms the Customer License system into a professional, BC-standard document management solution while maintaining backward compatibility and extending functionality for future business requirements.
