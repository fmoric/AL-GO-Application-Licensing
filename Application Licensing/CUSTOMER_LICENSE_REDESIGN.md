# Application License Management - Customer Header/Lines Redesign

## Overview
The Application Management system has been redesigned to follow Business Central's standard header/lines pattern, providing better organization, reporting capabilities, and consistency with BC design patterns.

## New Structure

### Header Table: Customer License Header (Table 80503)
- **Purpose**: Stores customer information and overall license timeline
- **Key Features**:
  - Customer contact information (name, email, phone, address)
  - Overall license validity period (calculated from lines)
  - License status (Active, Expired, Suspended, Revoked)
  - Statistics (number of applications, active licenses)
  - Audit fields (created/modified dates and users)

### Lines Table: Customer License Line (Table 80504)  
- **Purpose**: Stores applications assigned to each customer
- **Key Features**:
  - Links to Application Registry for app details
  - Individual license validity periods per application
  - License status per application
  - Features/capabilities enabled
  - License file generation status
  - Validation results and timestamps

### Master Data: Application Registry (Table 80500)
- **Purpose**: Master registry of available applications
- **Usage**: Unchanged - still manages available applications that can be licensed

## New Pages

### Customer License Management
- **Customer License List (Page 80510)**: Main list of customers with license overview
- **Customer License Card (Page 80511)**: Detail view with customer info and application subpage
- **Customer Application List (Page 80513)**: Dedicated page for managing customer's applications
- **Customer License FactBox (Page 80514)**: Statistics and summary information
- **Customer Application Lines (Page 80512)**: Subpage for application lines

### Utilities
- **License Migration (Page 80515)**: Migration utility for transitioning from old structure

## Key Benefits

1. **Standard BC Pattern**: Follows header/lines design used throughout Business Central
2. **Better Organization**: Customer-centric view with applications as lines
3. **Enhanced Reporting**: Easier to create customer-focused reports and analytics
4. **Improved Navigation**: Logical drill-down from customers to their applications
5. **Scalability**: Better performance with proper indexing and relationships
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add customer-specific fields and functionality

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Review Current Data
Use the "License Migration" page to check existing License Registry data.

### Step 2: Run Migration
Execute the migration utility to convert existing licenses to the new structure:
- Creates Customer License Headers from unique customer names
- Converts License Registry entries to Customer License Lines
- Preserves all license data and relationships
- Updates timeline information

### Step 3: Verify Results
Review migrated data in the new Customer License pages.

### Step 4: Update Processes
Update business processes to use the new customer-focused pages instead of the old application-focused ones.

## Technical Implementation

### New Codeunit: Customer License Management (80510)
Provides bulk operations for customer license management:
- `CreateCustomer()`: Create new customer license header
- `AddApplicationToCustomer()`: Add application to customer
- `GenerateAllCustomerLicenses()`: Bulk license generation
- `ValidateAllCustomerLicenses()`: Bulk license validation
- `MigrateExistingLicenses()`: Migration from old structure

### Enhanced Functionality
- Automatic license timeline calculation based on application lines
- Visual cues for expired/expiring licenses
- Customer-focused statistics and reporting
- Improved license file naming with customer context

## Compatibility

### Existing Code
- Application Registry table remains unchanged
- License Registry table continues to work for generated licenses
- Existing license generation and validation logic preserved
- All permissions updated to include new objects

### API Considerations
- New structure provides better API endpoints for customer-centric operations
- Maintains backward compatibility with application-focused operations
- Enhanced reporting capabilities through proper table relationships
