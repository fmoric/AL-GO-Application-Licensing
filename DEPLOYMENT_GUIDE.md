# Application Licensing - Deployment and Testing Guide

## Executive Summary

The Application Licensing system has been successfully split into two modular applications:

- **Base Application**: Standalone license import and validation (ID: 2a8ef067-5337-4f39-b645-93afa31c5995)
- **Generator Application**: License generation that extends Base functionality (ID: 3b9f1067-5337-4f39-b645-93afa31c5995)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Met

### ✅ Base Application is Fully Functional
- **License Import**: Complete import functionality from external license files
- **License Validation**: Comprehensive validation including signature verification
- **Application Management**: Full application registration and management
- **Standalone Operation**: Functions completely without Generator application

### ✅ Generator Cannot Operate Independently  
- **Dependency Declaration**: Explicit dependency on Base Application in app.json
- **Compilation Requirement**: Generator fails to compile without Base Application
- **Runtime Dependency**: Generator uses Base tables and cannot function without them
- **Proper Architecture**: Generator extends rather than duplicates Base functionality

### ✅ Clear Documentation
- **Architecture Documentation**: Comprehensive system design and component distribution
- **Implementation Guide**: Detailed steps for completing Generator implementation
- **Deployment Guide**: Step-by-step deployment and testing procedures
- **Integration Patterns**: Clear documentation of application interaction

## Deployment Instructions

### Phase 1: Base Application Deployment

#### Prerequisites
- Business Central environment (version 26.0 or later)
- Appropriate user permissions for application installation

#### Installation Steps
1. **Compile Base Application**
   ```powershell
   # Navigate to Base application directory
   cd "Application Licensing Base"
   
   # Compile the application
   alc.exe /project:. /packagecachepath:".alpackages"
   ```

2. **Deploy Base Application**
   ```powershell
   # Install Base application
   Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance BC -Path "Application Licensing Base.app" -SkipVerification
   Install-NAVApp -ServerInstance BC -Name "Application Licensing Base"
   ```

3. **Verify Base Installation**
   - Open Business Central
   - Navigate to **License Management Center**
   - Verify access to Application Registry and License Registry
   - Test license import functionality

#### Base Application Testing

**Test 1: Application Registration**
```
✓ Navigate to Application Registry
✓ Create new application entry
✓ Verify application appears in lookup lists
✓ Test application activation/deactivation
```

**Test 2: License Import**
```
✓ Navigate to License Import page
✓ Import a test license file
✓ Verify license appears in License Registry
✓ Test license validation functionality
```

**Test 3: License Management**
```
✓ View licenses in License Registry  
✓ Validate existing licenses
✓ Export license files
✓ Verify license status updates
```

### Phase 2: Generator Application Deployment

#### Prerequisites
- Base Application successfully installed and tested
- Crypto key management requirements understood
- User training on generation workflows

#### Installation Steps
1. **Compile Generator Application**
   ```powershell
   # Navigate to Generator application directory  
   cd "Application Licensing Generator"
   
   # Ensure Base application symbols are available
   # Compile Generator (requires Base dependency)
   alc.exe /project:. /packagecachepath:".alpackages"
   ```

2. **Deploy Generator Application**
   ```powershell
   # Install Generator application (Base must be installed first)
   Publish-NAVApp -ServerInstance BC -Path "Application Licensing Generator.app" -SkipVerification
   Install-NAVApp -ServerInstance BC -Name "Application Licensing Generator"
   ```

3. **Verify Generator Installation**
   - Generator should only install if Base is present
   - New generation functionality should be available
   - Base functionality should remain unchanged

#### Generator Application Testing

**Test 1: Dependency Verification**
```
✓ Attempt to install Generator without Base (should fail)
✓ Install Base first, then Generator (should succeed)  
✓ Verify Generator cannot be uninstalled if Base is removed
```

**Test 2: License Generation**
```
✓ Generate crypto keys in Generator
✓ Create test license through Generator
✓ Verify generated license appears in Base License Registry
✓ Validate generated license through Base validation
```

**Test 3: Integration Testing**
```
✓ Generate license in Generator application
✓ Export license from Base application
✓ Re-import exported license into different environment
✓ Verify full roundtrip functionality
```

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Base-Only Customer
**Customer Profile**: Only needs license import and validation

**Test Steps**:
1. Install Base Application only
2. Import external license files
3. Validate imported licenses
4. Manage application registry
5. Export licenses for distribution

**Expected Result**: Full functionality without Generator components

### Scenario 2: Full-Stack Customer  
**Customer Profile**: Needs both generation and import capabilities

**Test Steps**:
1. Install Base Application
2. Install Generator Application
3. Generate crypto keys
4. Create customer licenses
5. Generate license files
6. Verify licenses stored in Base registry
7. Test import/export functionality

**Expected Result**: Complete license lifecycle management

### Scenario 3: Upgrade Path Testing
**Customer Profile**: Existing customer upgrading from monolithic version

**Test Steps**:
1. Export existing license data
2. Install Base Application
3. Import existing licenses into Base
4. Verify license validation works
5. Install Generator Application
6. Migrate crypto keys to Generator
7. Test generation workflow

**Expected Result**: Seamless upgrade with maintained functionality

## Performance Validation

### Base Application Performance
- **License Import**: Should handle files up to 1MB efficiently
- **License Validation**: Validation should complete within 2 seconds
- **Registry Queries**: List views should load within 3 seconds

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Installation Issues

**Issue**: Generator fails to install
- **Cause**: Base Application not installed or incorrect version
- **Solution**: Install Base Application first, verify version compatibility

**Issue**: Base Application features missing after Generator installation
- **Cause**: Permission conflicts or deployment order issue
- **Solution**: Reinstall Base Application, then Generator

**Issue**: License validation fails after upgrade
- **Cause**: Schema changes or permission updates
- **Solution**: Re-import licenses, check permission assignments

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Slow license generation
- **Cause**: Crypto key size or system resources
- **Solution**: Verify system requirements, optimize key parameters

**Issue**: License Registry queries timeout
- **Cause**: Large datasets or missing indexes
- **Solution**: Archive old licenses, verify database maintenance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks
1. **Daily**: Verify license validation services
2. **Weekly**: Check crypto key expiration dates  
3. **Monthly**: Review license generation performance
4. **Quarterly**: Validate application dependencies

### Backup Procedures
1. **License Registry**: Regular backup of license data
2. **Crypto Keys**: Secure backup of key materials
3. **Application Registry**: Backup of application definitions
4. **Configuration**: System configuration backup

### Security Maintenance
